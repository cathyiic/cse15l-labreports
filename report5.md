# Here is my lab report 5 for week 10 using the implementations that we experimented with in Week 9

In week 9's lab and in this lab report, I will be using the TA's repo for testing and implementations. [Link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser) to the TA's repo.

*When attempting to find the test with different results, I worked with using the `bash script.sh` command. I cloned the **script.sh** from the TA's repo and edited it so that it would run the test file. I assumed that I would have to use the `vimdiff` command, so I created a new file called **my-test** to see how my results would run in comparison to what the ones ran from the TA's code ran*


**First Test File**

Here is the link to the first test file that I chose to work with, [510.md](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/510.md). 





**Seconf Test File**

**1. How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? 
Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)**


**2. Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or your repository , either is fine)**


**3. For each test:
Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).
Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site. 
Note : Following shows a screenshot of a markdown file and its preview. Even though “some-url.com” and “google.com” are shown as links (highlighted in blue)
that is not what we are looking for in MarkdownParse and the correct expected output would simply be [ucsd.edu].**


**4. For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3 sentences.
You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed 
(Provide a screenshot of code and highlight where the change needs to be made).**
