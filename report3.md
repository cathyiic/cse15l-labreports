**Streamlining ssh Configuration**


Here is my .ssh/config file that I created inside of the file, ednafiles, that we worked on during the last lab. ![](sshconfig.png)
In addition, I copied this config file using the `cp` command to copy it to `.ssh/config`.

Here is where I used the ssh command to log into my CSE15L account with my alias. Since I had created the **config** file and written all of my account login info, I can just call `ssh ieng6` to log into my cse15l account. ![](ssh ieng6.png)
