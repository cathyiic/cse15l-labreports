# This is my week 2 lab report that will give a tutorial on how to login to the ieng6 account

**Installing VScode**

1. Download VSCode for your OS, in this report, I will be using a MAC OS.
        - Use this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download VSCode

2. After you finish downloading VSCode, open the application. Your screen should look someting like this. ![](vscode.png)


**Remotely Connecting**

1. Now that you have VSCode set up, open up the terminal. I recommend splitting the terminal, so you can work on your ieng6 account and your own local account.
        - You can do this my clicking Terminal in the top left corner (for Mac), new terminal, and right clicking your terminal to *split* the terminal.

2. To remotely connect, you will need your ieng6 email and a password that you will create on the server. You can use this [document](https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/paste/ktv2gnof3sx5bf/181c3cb053df5cf1ccaf0457f56f12a2e5aa90b139aef8c2ea8fcc590f02fadf/How-to-Reset-your-Password.pdf) to change your password for your course-specific account.

3. For my example, my account username is cs15lsp22amm@ieng6.ucsd.edu, and I have my password changed. I will use the ssh command to finally remotely connect. If you are using Windows, you will need to download [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) to utilize the ssh command.

4. Your terminal should look something like this after you have remotely connected
